# Glass Launcher Legacy
A much more lightweight approach to what PyMCL was trying to do.

## Features

- Made in Java
- Instancing that works.

## Compiling

Maven project coming soon.
- Import this project into Intellij
- Go to `Build > Build Artifacts...`
- Click on `Build` in the pop up
- Profit!  

All dependencies will be in the lib directory.

## Usage

You can just double click the jar file to launch the launcher normally.  
Launch with `-proxy` to launch just the proxy.

## Issues

- No instance creation of any kind
- No working config.
